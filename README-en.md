# Pixiv Infinite Scroll

Add an infinite scroll function to Pixiv. When you scroll to the bottom of a page, it will automatically load the next page, allowing you to view illustrations without interruption.  
It can be used in "Search Results", "User Profile", "Following", "Works by users you are following", and "Bookmarks".  

Currently, the novel is not supported.
